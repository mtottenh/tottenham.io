Hi, I'm {{ site.author.name }}, I currently work for {{ site.author.company }}
as a {{ site.author.job }} out of their {{ site.author.location }} office. If I
don't update this blog ever, well that's because I'm lazy. But for now expect
the half hearted post or two about tech, BBQ, or whatever else I feel like.

Oh and now for the legal crap:
The views expressed on this site are solely those of the author in his private capacity
and do not in any way represent the views of {{ site.author.company }}. It
should be quite obvious that {{ site.author.company }} has not approved,
endorsed, embraced, friended, liked, tweeted or authorized this post.
