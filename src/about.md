Hi, I'm {{ site.author.name }}, I currently work for {{ site.author.company }}
as a {{ site.author.job }} out of their {{ site.author.location }} office. 
I'm generally rather terrible about updating this blog, life gets in the way.
But expect the half hearted post or two about tech, BBQ, or whatever else I
feel like.
