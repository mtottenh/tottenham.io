subtitle: Getting down with i386 assembler

# Intro

Gee how times flies, my intention was to update this blog weekly, well I've
managed an update at an average of about once every 2 years. 

This is a continuation of the XV6 exploration series, several years ago I wrote
some instructions to boot XV6 using Qemu, in this post I'll dig into what is
happening under the hood all the way up to the boot prompt.

Some basic knowledge of x86 assembler might be useful, (I thoroughly recommend
the book x86 assembly step by step), but I'll do my best to attempt the
important op-codes and the relevant i386 architectural background.

## XV6 The Boot Process, Overview

Platform setup, the thing that happens between pressing the power switch on
your computer and being presented with, in the case of XV6, a blinking prompt,
is specific to processor (and indeed the wider computer system) architectures.

But at a basic level, the power switch triggers the CPU (although on some
SoCs/exotic architectures it's actually a different processor like the GPU) to
reset to a known starting state, fetch an instructions from the _reset vector_
\- this is a hard coded address that is CPU architecture specific, but usually
this ends up being the start of the platform firmware. It then executes the
platform firmware which may perform certain things like testing the presence of
memory, performing a CPU self test to ensure it's working as expected, loading
any configured Option ROMs to provide early support for networking etc, before
finally handing off control to the next part of the boot process (which could
vary depending on the firmware configuration, e.g. disk v.s. pxe network boot). 

As we've configured our firmware to boot from disk, it helpfully will load the
first disk sector that is marked with a special flag (the start of the XV6 boot
code), to a fixed address, and then perform a jump to the fixed address and
start executing our code.

So the first job of the boot code that XV6 has is as follows (in no specific order):

- Set up the memory addressing mode to be flat/paged
- Enable the A20 Gate (an x86 quirk, doing this allows us to access memory >1MB)
- Load the rest of our operating system kernel into memory (we've only got 512 bytes remember!)
- Set up various descriptor tables
- Transition into 32bit 'protected' mode (or 64bit 'long' mode).
- Jump to the next bit of our operating system code


In the case of X86 based processors - the power switch provides a signal on the
RESET input to the CPU (a physical pin on the chip), this resets the CPU to a
well known state (one that is compatible with the 80386), and it starts
fetching code from FFFF:0000h. Again - depending on your platform and firmware,
several things may happen, in our case we've instructed Qemu to emulate a
PC-BIOS based system (rather than the newer EFI standard).

x86 CPUs are curious beasts, they contain lots of historical baggage, and as
such when they are reset (like when you push the power button, or our virtual
Qemu equivalent), they start in a mode called _real mode_. This CPU mode limits
the number and width of available general purpose registers, and it also limits
the amount of accessible main memory, and uses a _segmented_ rather than _flat_
addressing model, that is addresses are provided via a segment:offset combo,
with the segment loaded in a special _segment register_ and the offset provided
by a separate register. While we could write an operating system just using the
CPU in real mode, we'd be leaving a bunch of hardware resources on the floor.
Additionally - it's often a pain to work using a segmented memory model, and
x86 CPUs support a simple flat addressing model that was added later.
