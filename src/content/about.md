Hi, I'm {{< param Author.Name >}}, I currently work for {{< param Author.Company >}}
as a {{< param Author.Job >}} out of their {{< param Author.Location >}} office. 
I'm generally rather terrible about updating this blog; life gets in the way.
But expect the half-hearted post or two about tech, photography, or whatever else I
feel like.
